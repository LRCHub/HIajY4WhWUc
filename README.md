[00:14.23] You've more or less forgotten me this summer
[00:22.09] And I can't hide my disappointment
[00:29.43] I was on my way in the Phantom V
[00:38.45] The one you gave away
[00:48.95] 
[00:44.95] Try to tell you that I love you but I'm choked up
[00:48.69] You forgot and that makes me feel like no one (summer nights)
[00:52.04] Was you ever really there? Did you ever really feel?
[00:56.63] Wait, I got so many examples of all of the good times we had
[01:01.45] Long summer nights (summer nights)
[01:03.71] Held you a long time, put your name in my rhyme
[01:07.08] Refresh your memory of where you wanna be
[01:10.58] The Phantom's on the way, she's comin' down the street
[01:37.58] 
[01:14.52] I tried to get to Atlanta
[01:17.83] On a peach blossom highway
[01:21.53] I'm tryin' to put these pauses out of mind
[01:29.11] In a sky made of diamonds
[01:32.80] Where the world fell silent
[01:36.62] I'll be waiting for you on the other side
[01:57.12] 
[01:43.44] Summer lights
[01:49.94] 
[02:12.98] Summer nights
[02:14.16] I tried to say I love you
[02:17.32] But you didn't listen (summer nights)
[02:21.43] I tried to give you everything you might need (summer nights)
[02:28.48] In a sky made of diamonds
[02:32.79] And where the world is flawless
[02:35.90] I'll be waiting for you on the other side
[02:56.40] 
[02:42.64] Of summer lights, summer lights
[02:51.07] Hold it in for a long time
[02:57.76] Summer lights, seems to me I'm in a dream
[03:05.79] Behind these summer lights
[03:18.79] 
[03:13.53] The Phantom is coming
[03:16.88] You forgot and that makes me feel like no one
[03:21.08] She's crossing over the line
[03:26.27] Wait, I got so many examples of all of the good times we had
[03:29.44] Seems to me I'm in a dream
[03:35.14] (Put your name in my rhyme, refresh your memory)
[03:37.85] (Or where you wanna be) these summer lights
[03:40.18] (The Phantom's on the way)
[03:41.66] (She's comin' down the street)
[03:56.66] 
[03:50.10] Summer nights
